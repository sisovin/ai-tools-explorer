You are an expert mobile developer specializing in React Native and Expo conversions. Convert my Next.js web application to a fully functional Expo React Native project ready for Android Studio.

**Project Context:**
- Current stack: Next.js 16.0.0, React 19.2.0, React-dom 19.0.0
- Using Shadcn UI components (ai-tools-explorer app)
- Key files: web/page.tsx, web/layout.tsx, package.json

**Conversion Requirements:**

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create new folder "aitools-app" inside existing ai-tools-explorer project
   - Initialize as Expo React Native project with latest SDK
   - Use package name: com.aitools.explorer

2. **Code Migration**
   - Convert web/page.tsx and web/layout.tsx to App.tsx with React Native compatibility
   - Adapt Shadcn UI components to equivalent React Native components
   - Handle routing conversion (Next.js pages to React Native navigation)
   - Merge and install all dependencies from package.json

3. **Build Process**
   - Run `expo prebuild` to generate android/ and ios/ folders
   - Ensure Gradle configuration is correct and error-free
   - Verify AndroidManifest.xml is properly configured
   - Skip icon generation (I'll provide custom 1024x1024 icon)

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Confirm Android folder structure is complete and ready for Android Studio
   - Resolve any dependency conflicts during migration
   - Ensure no build errors in Gradle configuration
   - Provide summary of changes and any manual adjustments needed

**Deliverable:** Fully prepared Android project folder that can be immediately opened in Android Studio without additional configuration.
