üß™ Best Practices (Python-Focused)

- Modularization: Separate routes, models, and templates into distinct modules.
- Environment Management: Use .env for secrets and config; load with python-dotenv.
- Dependency Control: Use pip-tools or Poetry for reproducible environments.
- Validation: Use Pydantic (FastAPI) or WTForms (Flask) for input validation.
- Testing: Pytest for unit and integration tests; coverage reports for CI.
- Logging: Structured logging with logging module; log rotation for production.
- Documentation: Auto-generate API docs with Swagger (FastAPI) or Markdown specs.

---

üìà Performance & Optimization

- Lazy Loading: Defer image loading for faster initial render.
- Caching: Use Flask-Caching or FastAPI's cache tools for repeated queries.
- Pagination: Limit tool results per page to reduce load.
- Minification: Compress CSS/JS assets for production.
- CDN Integration: Serve static assets via CDN for global performance.

üöÄ Deployment Strategy

- Dev Environment: Localhost with auto-reload
- Staging: Dockerized container on cloud VM (e.g., Render, Heroku, Railway)
- Production: Gunicorn + Nginx stack or serverless deployment (e.g., Vercel with Python backend API)
- Monitoring: UptimeRobot or Prometheus for health checks
